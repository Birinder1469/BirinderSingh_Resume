My career aspirations are not my childhood dreams rather they are a work of regular absorption of knowledge and information.

After an extensive career in the Oil and Gas industry where I was involved in small hacks I finally decided to take a plunge and build over my Tech skills full time.

I am currently Master of Data Science students at The University of British Columbia, Vancouver 2018-2019 graduating in June, 2019 looking for full time opportunity as a Data Scientist.
